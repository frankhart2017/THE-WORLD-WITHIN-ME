Remembering the days of ecstasy
Sighing, grieved by the pain of separation
Watching the red giant bid farewell for the day
I sat in the park all alone

In the days of happiness, when we sat there together
I ignored the warnings of the immortal giant
Thus the enigmatic rock mountain
Mocked me endlessly, laughing on my loneliness

Lonely are those persons whose soul wanders
Yours safely rests inside her
Then how can you be lonely
Assured the veteran oak

The elements of nature
Reignited the embers of agony
A sudden realization struck me
I am really lonely

I asked the protecting banyan
How can I talk with her now?
She rests in the land
Where languages are unknown

Languages barrier those
Who use medium to communicate
But when hearts are connected
It is just a useless commodity
Replied the wise old pond
Giving me a faint hope

Just then I heard a sweet voice
One with which I was very familiar
She was in front of me
But the bitter truth was I could not touch her
We still communicate
But the loneliness remains buried inside me
