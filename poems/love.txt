As I strolled past the singers
I could see their lamented eyes
Eyes that revealed an old story through their voices
And it said love never dies

In some dark abyss, embers still glow
It compels to be brought to life
Wants to be rejuvenated with the previous vigour
Because love never dies.

Though I sincerely try
To veil our love for each other
With a false mask of hatred, but deep inside
I know that love never dies.

Though the wall is diminutive
Still it shields us from each other
Now when I realize the mistake, it hurts
And I believe that love never dies.

That day still haunts me
The day when the devil ruled
And confession seemed to hurt it
But now I feel that love never dies.

A man can always lie
But eyes are amateur at concealing
Or maybe it is the love
As love never dies.

We are far apart
But our souls are still united
So, the folks correctly said
That love never dies.
