In pleasures she lost her innocence
That ethereal smile is in jeopardy
Replaced with tears of repentance
With smirks that betray her nature

She walks through the dark lanes
Contemplating on her mistakes
Remembering those joyous memories
With tears welled up in her eyes

She patiently sought his arrival
Days passed by without his sign
She wreathed in pain
Yet she believed that she would see him again

She still remembers the day
She placed her trust on him
And the day he crushed it 
Leaving her alone with her fears

Every night the moon and stars
Behold her engulfed in sadness
With no one to wipe her tears
But the pillow she rests on

In the morning she again 
Puts on her mask of cheerfulness
Veiling her anguish
For the world mocks the weak ones

She still struggles with her soul that loved
The heart that was broken
The memories of the halcyon days
In a futile hope of his return

Her eyes still gleam 
With a ray of hope
A hope that bonds her, makes her strong
A hope that has kept her alive
