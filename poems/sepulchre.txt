THE RED GIANT BID ITS FAREWELL
THE COFFIN WAS LOWERED
AND WITH IT ALL HER LOVE WAS BURIED
BUT THE MEMORIES STILL REMAIN IN THE SEPULCHRE

MY SOUL ACHED WITH AGONY
MY HEART OVERFLOWED WITH SORROW
NOTHING COULD BE MORE HEART BREAKING
THAN THE SEPULCHRE OF MY MOTHER

I REMEMBER THE HALCYON DAYS
WHENEVER I SAT ALONE IN THE DARKNESS
SHE EMPATHIZED WITH ME, CHEERED ME
OH! HOW I WISH SHE COULD DO THAT AGAIN

I MISS THOSE STORIES OF HERS
WHICH I CONFRONTED WITH APATHY THEN
NOW WITHOUT HER PRESENCE I REPENT THOSE TIMES
THOSE PRECIOUS MOMENTS I LOST

SHE HAD A CALM DEMEANOUR
AS THEY LOWERED HER TO HER RESTING PLACE
FREED FROM THE AGONIES OF HER DAILY LIFE
HER ETHEREAL SOUL GLEAMED WITH AN EPHEMERAL LOVE

IT HAS BEEN A DECADE SINCE THEN
WHENEVER I VISIT HER
I FEEL AN AURA OF LOVE THAT IS MEANT ONLY FOR ME
I FEEL HER PRESENCE, I RECALL HER MEMORIES
NEITHER THE PAIN NOR THE LOVE FADED
SUCH IS THE PULCHRITUDE OF MY MOTHER’S SEPULCHRE
