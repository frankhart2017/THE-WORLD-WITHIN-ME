In the dark abyss
In the lighted cities
Behind the dense foliage
In the open streets
I search the lost me

In the temples
At the churches
In those pictures
And in my memories
I search the lost me

Among the happy faces
In the gloomy corners
Above the inferno
Under the heaven
I search the lost me

Among the playing boys
Among the old men
In the schools
And in the old age homes
I search the lost me

In the innocent games
In those malignant minds
In the future
And in the past
I search the lost me

Finally a day came
In some corner
Eyes on screen, hands on keys
Working for long hours
I found the lost me

Completely unaware of the worldly joys
Unknown to the healthy world outside
I sit and work and sometimes sigh
But that is now my life and I have to be happy with it
Thus I found the lost me
