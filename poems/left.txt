In the days I sigh
In the nights I cry
I feel asphyxiated every second
Since the day she left

The pictures on the wall haunt me
The ring pains me
I feel all alone
Since the day she left

I have become numb
I feel but I can’t feel
The grief will last till eternity
Still I will have to live
For life will not wait
I am anguished
Since the day she left

The smile has faded
The life sucked out of me
I am a living dead
Since the day she left

For the world of well wishers
I smile, I am compelled to smile
For tears are for weak
And them to mock

This anguish will never leave
And never will it let me live
Now I have accepted the harsh truth
So, I live now pretending to be happy
Such is the grief

Since the day she left
