When the senses are lost
When one cannot breathe
And heart stops beating; that is when death comes
The doctor said

When the soul bids farewell to the mortal body
When your work in this physical world ends
And god calls you; that is when death comes
The priest replied

When you are under pressure
When life has no meaning left
And quitting seems the only choice; that is when death comes
The student answered

When you cannot earn enough
When you are helpless
And the debts seem to be ever rising; that is when death comes
The poor man said

When your love abandons you
When every day is a punishment
And life seems worthless; that is when death comes
The lover replied

After the mature opinions
I finally asked a small child

When you stop listening to your heart
When you try to change yourself for others
When you become selfish
When you stop smiling
And grief is with you; that is when death comes
The small kid answered
