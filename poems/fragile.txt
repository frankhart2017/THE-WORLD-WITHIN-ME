Dejected and sad I sat there
Watching the saplings mock a fragile tree
After years of glory and ensconcement
Its soul now aches to be free

They say it is now old
It cannot bear wind and cold
They declared it a liability
But I saw it engulf the sun, wasn't it an extraordinary ability

It witnessed generations pass by
Suffered the agony of separation
Now it is aghast, knowing the fact
That its own young saplings are showing signs of exasperation

All of them said it was her idiosyncrasy
Her dissent to not depart yet
Even after this disdainful behaviour 
She remains calm and tranquil

Everyday she weeps in anguish
Frets about her off-springs
Believes that someday they will realize her love
She now waits for that day

Even after all the hatred she has to protect them
But she is weak now, she is nothing but a fragile tree.
