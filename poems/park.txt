Away from the noisy city
Far from the diseasing air
I had a walk one pleasant evening
In the serene bushes

Leaving behind all the arguments
All my tensions
I had a carefree walk
In the dense foliage

Frustrated from the complaining world
I entered the abode of the tolerant
I discovered myself
In those woodlands

Exasperated by the sound of the automobiles
And the various scientific 'marvels'
I walked enjoying the soothing chirps of the birds
In those tranquil surroundings

Out of the reveries of the unreal world
I delved into the nature
To discover my true potential I strolled
In the green lands

The various trees old and young enhancing the
Beauty of the surroundings
The experienced ones narrating their anguish over the years
In the land where purity flows

Time destroys all and perishes the most powerful
But it too failed to fade
The beauty of the nature
And thus the various trees with its
Living population continue to
Soothe the restless in its calm lap
I experienced a sudden ecstasy
In the peaceful nature
