I remember the day
When I first learnt to embrace your smile
When I let my fears pass
And let you submerge into my ocean of feelings

I remember the day
I gave up my doubts
Let those counterfeit feelings grasp me
And gave you an important role

I remember the day
When I let those soothing words of yours sink in
And mesmerize me in a way
That I am unable to wear off

I remember the day
I let you be a part
Of my reveries and my thoughts
Unaware of the approaching nightmares

I remember the day
I disapproved what others told me
And let your aura lure me
Into an abode difficult to leave

I remember the day
You taught me to see past beauty
And into the pulchritudinous soul
That I was yet to fathom

I remember the day
You gave me a new emotion
That transformed my world
And the day you took it from me

I remember the day
I was compelled to deceive others
To believe in you
And in your numerous fantasies

I remember the day
When I genuinely lost my way
