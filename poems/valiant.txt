In the heat of summer
Asphyxiated by the numerous creepers
It stood tall nonchalantly
Though it writhed with pain

Those who were considered family
Drained its life every day
Still it stoically bore them
As it never learned to fight

The old age weakened its might
The one which could once resist a tornado
Was now fragile and helpless
But it still held itself upright

In the days of its youth
Its girth could withstand mighty blows
Now the mites have crumbled it from inside
But it refuses to fall down

Around it grew the future
Who witnessed its worsening health
Lost in their reveries
Completely blind to its nightmares

In spite of all the agonies and sufferings
It continued to protect the striplings
With its downfall there would be devastation
Thus the valiant one stood firmly in its place
