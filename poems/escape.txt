I escaped one day into the woods
Away from the cheers and mockery
From the joys and the agonies
Into the serenity of the dense foliage

I fled away from my strengths
My weaknesses and frailties 
And plunged myself into
The calm rustling of the leaves

I entered into an unclear and hazy world
Covered with mist and fog
Still I continued my walk
As not always do we need to know the destination

I deposited my fears safely
Inside a closet back at home
To spend some time with the nature
And to listen to my inner call

The sun now reached the horizon
The sky appeared golden
Darkness started outweighing light
Still I continued my stroll

I walk without the knowledge
Of various dangers that I may encounter
Contemplating on my actions I continue
Along the dark road 

My mind was numbed
By the various sounds that called for me
But I walked without paying attention
As sometimes no one can stop me

I finally reached a point
Where the path ahead was completely invisible
But I still continued on my steps 
As the path refused to intersect
