The mind revolts to think
My pen doesn’t cooperate
It is exasperating
When I can’t write

The days seem long
The nights are restless
It bothers me every second
When I can’t write

The many stories fade away
The ideas flushed from memory
I sit grief stricken
When I can’t write

The long sighs
The moments of anguish don’t help
I stay calm for anger will not help
When I can’t write

The beautiful Mother Nature
The immortal surroundings mock me
I listen to my weaknesses
When I can’t write

The morning heat evaporates
The evening breeze carries away with it
Every speck of idea from me
And I helplessly stand there
When I can’t write

The words seem to fly by
Expressions bid farewell
I still remain stoic
When I can’t write

I feel that someday
I will find the lost me
And that day I will write
I hope and I pray
That day comes soon
When I will write
