Crammed in the darkness
Where only my sound reverberates
Cutting myself from the outside world
I sit alone as a living dead

The days and nights
Seem similar to me
I lie emotionless as the time goes by
As I am now a living dead

The outside world mocks me
I can’t stop them
As it is human nature; I don’t blame them
As I am a living dead

My soul is exasperated
From the loneliness; it detests my mortal frame
Still it is compelled to live
Inside the living dead

My inner counterpart longs for someone
Someone who can bring light
And help me overcome my loneliness
But till then I am a living dead

The days are like years
Time has stopped moving
And I stand alone in the world
And it seems that I am a living dead

Everyone seems to be busy
Surrounded by friends
But I sit alone in some dark corner
And I feel like a living dead

I am waiting for the day
When the special one
Will lead me towards the path of light

And make me living again from living dead
