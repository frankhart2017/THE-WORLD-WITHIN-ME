Among the huge expanse of rock
I saw a tiny sapling struggling towards the sunshine
Bruised and contused
Still forcing its way from under the burying weight

After all the setbacks
And the never ending difficulties
It rose from its sepulchre
On a journey to glory

It finds its trail through the pores
And the cracks on those weighing it down
Growing everyday with renewed vigour
As it has to fulfil its dreams

With its incessant hope 
For a day when the floundering will come to an end
And those who tried to entomb it
Will witness its eminence

A day when it finally achieves grandeur
And those who once tried to thrust it to earth
Will be stupefied with its magnificence
And will bow down before its might

That day it will be the one 
Who mocks and dominates others
Till then it continues its hope
Waiting for the reveries to be realized
